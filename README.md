# Personal Data Science and Data Analytics Projects
Welcome to my repository of personal data science and data analytics projects! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects where I explore and analyze various datasets using data science techniques. The data used in these projects are open-source and primarily sourced from various Kaggle datasets, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

## Tools and Technologies
The projects in this repository are primarily implemented using the following programming languages and tools:

**Python:** The key libraries used are pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
<br>**R:** The key libraries used were ggplot and tidy the majority of analysis done in R is stored in the R Markdown titled baseball_analytics. Most of the projects I have done in R are stored in the repository titled STOR-320.
